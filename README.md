# Titan: Veiled Tempest

**WARNING:** This is a Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed with the StationeersLaunchPad plugin.
See: [StationeersLaunchPad](https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad)

## Description
'Titan: Veiled Tempest' is my attempt at creating a more challenging alternative to Europa, inspired by other Titan versions by *Vivien* and *murk*. This version features two different weather events:
- **Acid Methane Rain (Volatiles)** - Most commonly occurring.
- **Snow Storms** - Less frequent but still hazardous.

These world settings can function independently, but for the intended experience, installing [StationeersLaunchPad](https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad) is required.

## Features with StationeersLaunchPad Installed
- The **first weather event** occurs **after 1 day** instead of 7.
- The **first weather event** is always **Acid Rain**.
- **Acid Rain** and **Snow Storms** do *not* trigger forced follow-up events (e.g., 'Regular' rain).

For an added challenge, consider using **Free Lunch's Structure Thermodynamics mod** alongside this world:

## Gameplay Tips
- **Prepare early!** Weather events will start quickly, so prioritize creating a **safe storage space**.
- **Beware of airlocks!** Acid Rain leaves **liquid volatile puddles**, which do *not* count towards room pressure. Use a **custom airlock script** or a **manual airlock with a liquid drain**.
- **Solar power is ineffective** due to frequent storms, but **wind power is reliable**.
- **Coal is rare on the surface** but can be found using **deep miners**.
- **Oxite ice is scarce**, but **Nitric ice can substitute** for furnace usage.
- **Leverage the cold atmosphere**—**Gas Fuel Generators** are easier to set up.

## Disclaimer
The Terrain Data for this world is currently just a copy of Europa
Map layout, Spawn Points, Named Regions and Deep Mining Regions are therefore exactly the same as on Europa.
In later updates I might include my own terrain data.
