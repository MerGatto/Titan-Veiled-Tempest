[h1]Titan -  Veiled Tempest[/h1]
[b]WARNING:[/b] This is a Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed with the StationeersLaunchPad plugin.
See: [url=https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad]StationeersLaunchPad[/url]

[h2]Description[/h2]
'Titan: Veiled Tempest' is my attempt at creating a more challenging alternative to Europa, inspired by other Titan versions by [b]Vivien[/b] and [b]murk[/b]. This version features two different weather events:
[list]
[*][b]Acid Methane Rain (Volatiles)[/b] - Most commonly occurring.
[*][b]Dust Storms[/b] - Less frequent but still hazardous.
[/list]
These world settings can function independently, but for the intended experience, installing [url=https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad]StationeersLaunchPad[/url] is required.

[h3]Features with StationeersLaunchpad Installed[/h3]
[list]
[*]The [b]first weather event[/b] occurs [b]after 1 day[/b] instead of 7.
[*]The [b]first weather event[/b] is always [b]Acid Rain[/b].
[*][b]Acid Rain[/b] and [b]Storms[/b] do [b]not[/b] trigger forced follow-up events (e.g., 'Regular' rain).
[/list]

For an added challenge, consider using  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3336803492]Free Lunch's Structure Thermodynamics mod[/url] alongside this world.

[h2]Gameplay Tips[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]Prepare early![/b] Weather events will start quickly, so prioritize creating a [b]safe storage space[/b].
[*][b]Beware of airlocks![/b] Acid Rain leaves [b]liquid volatile puddles[/b], which do [b]not[/b] count towards room pressure. Use a [b]custom airlock script[/b] or a [b]manual airlock with a liquid drain[/b].
[*][b]Solar power is ineffective[/b] due to frequent storms, but [b]wind power is reliable[/b].
[*][b]Coal is rare on the surface[/b] but can be found using [b]deep miners[/b].
[*][b]Oxite ice is scarce[/b], but [b]Nitric ice can substitute[/b] for furnace usage.
[*][b]Leverage the cold atmosphere[/b]â€”[b]Gas Fuel Generators[/b] are easier to set up.
[/list]

[h2]Disclaimer[/h2]
The Terrain Data for this world is currently just a copy of Europa.
Map layout, Spawn Points, Named Regions and Deep Mining Regions are therefore exactly the same as on Europa.
In later updates I might include my own terrain data.
